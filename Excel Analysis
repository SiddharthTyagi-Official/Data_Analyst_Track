let our Data have some rows
Sales Person	Geography	Product	Amount	Units	Cost per unit	Cost

# Quick statistics
  Average--> =AVERAGE(data[Amount])
  Median--> =MEDIAN(data[Amount])
  Minimum--> =MIN(data[Amount])
  Maximum--> =MAX(Data[Amount])
  Range--> Max- Min
  First Quadrant--> =PERCENTILE.EXC(data[Amount],0.25)
  Third Quadrant-->  =PERCENTILE.EXC(data[Amount],0.75)
  
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with CF
  Select Amount Column then conditional Formatting then color scales
  then go to manage rules and edit the rule as per analysis required
  even we can mark duplicate and top 10 values with CF 
  
#Sales by country (with formulas)
  Fist go to the Data then select the whole geography column then paste then
  go to the Data and select remove duplicate you will unique value
  Then for get amount for each Country will use this formula 
  =SUMIFS(data[Amount],data[Geography],C6/C7....)
  then for get unit 
  =SUMIFS(data[Units],data[Geography],C6/C7....)
  
  Now we have to make that data Creative first sort by amount
  then insert a column then copy and paste the data of amount column 
  thereafter we have to go Data bar then manage rules-- edit rules
  then show bars only
  make header fill with some light colour
  make unit values font colour different so that it become eye catching and insightfull
